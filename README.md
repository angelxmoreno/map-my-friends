# map-my-friends

A sample application for the GA JS-320 class 

## Why make this? 
As an EIR at General Assembly for the JS-320 (Javascript) course, I wanted to
create a sample application encompassing some examples of what I have seen students
having some difficulty with. 

## Goals

#### Personal
1. Provide a sample final project
2. Make use of the topics learned in class
3. Make use of topics students of class JS-320 inquired the most about

#### Application
1. Make use of the various Google Maps API
3. Make use of Firebase
1. Make use of Oath not supported by Firebase
1. Successfully Work with Oauth on the front-end without sacrificing a first-born

## Tools, SDKs and APIs used

A CSS framework: because this is a JS class, not a UI class

A routing library: to provide an SPA ( Single Page Application ) expirience

Firebase: the database

Foursquare API: to fetch friends

Google Maps APIs: to map my friends

A no-oauth JS proxy to authenticate users

Bower: package manager for web libraries
